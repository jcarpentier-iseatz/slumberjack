Slumberjack is a slog viewer with XML syntax highlighting and formatting to make your life easier.

-------------- Installation ----------------
You should have cloned the Mercurial repository into the folder you want Slumberjack to live. If not, move it there now.  We will wait...

Slumberjack comes with a handy installer that will copy the vhost file to your Apache vhost folder (pointing it at the install folder), add slumberjack to your hosts file, and restart apache.

If your vhost files live in /etc/apache2/vhosts, you are ready to install.  If not, the first argument to the installer is the location of your vhost files.

Run the installer:
  sudo ./install (path_to_vhost_folder)

If you want to install manually:
  Install the Sinatra gem 'sudo gem install sinatra'
  Copy slumberjack.conf to your vhost folder and edit it to point to the correct path (install_folder)/public.
  Add an entry to your /etc/hosts to point slumberjack to 127.0.0.1
  Restart Apache.

Enjoy.
